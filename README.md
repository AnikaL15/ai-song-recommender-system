# ai-song-recommender-system

Our team project to build an AI-powered music recommender that suggests songs based on user preferences, using ranking, clustering, and user embeddings.

This project aims to create a personalized Spotify music recommender using data from the Million Song Dataset and each user’s own Spotify listening data.
We’ll build three main models (Ranking, Clustering, and User Embeddings) and connect them to an AI agent that interprets user prompts like “give me songs for studying” or “find tracks like Arctic Monkeys.”

The final product will be a Streamlit app that recommends songs interactively.
